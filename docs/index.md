The `qemacs` text editor is meant to be a text editor merging the power
of [`Emacs`](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) concepts with the
amazing abilities of the [`Qt` library](https://www.qt.io/):
`qemacs=Qt+Emacs`.

# Main features

`qemacs` provides with advanced major modes for:

- Editing and compiling `MFront` files <http://tfel.sourceforge.net>
- Editing and running `MTest` files <http://tfel.sourceforge.net>
- Editing and running `Licos` input files (see
  <https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0029549315003842>).
- Editing and running `Cast3M` input files <http://www-cast3m.cea.fr>
- etc.

## Portability

`qemacs` is being developped and tested on:

- `Debian LiNuX` (gcc, clang)
- `Windows` (Visual Studio 2015 and 2017)

`qemacs` is expected to work on most platforms where
[`TFEL`](http://tfel.sourceforge.net/) and [`Qt`](https://www.qt.io/)
have been ported, which makes it quite universal.
